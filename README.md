# Projects
A repository for a large variety of projects I have created over my career of doing Computer Science.

Glossary:
 - Scientific Method: A game I made and produced art assets for with the 8-Bit Art program as a Women and Gender Studies final project. It simulates the imagined process of performing research in a scientific institute with attention paid to the differences in experience that people of varying identities face based on reports from government studies and journalistic writings I read.
     - A good framework and baseline is present, however some implementations are undesirable and require me to do further work to achieve the desired performance, especially with respect to my troubles in exporting the program that forced the art assets to be referenced by the user at run-time.

 - Mandelbrot Viewer: A program that displays a shallow image of the Mandelbrot Set; that is, it does not permit the infinite zooming-in that is definitive of the Mandelbrot Set visualization, but does display its top-most image, and permit some zooming/moving around the image alongside a selection of corruptions that produce interesting visuals.
 
 - Data Storage: A program that manages the categorical storing of data in text format, allowing sorted or searched-for viewing of that information to the user at their convenience.
 
 - 8-Bit Art: An art program I created to permit me to produce my own art assets during the production of several other projects; a great host of useful features have been included to make the usage of this application convenient and efficient for whatever the artistic need may be (as long as it is below approximately 500x500 pixels in size. It still works, but performance declines as that rises, thus the focus on low-poly art designs.)
     - I'm really proud of this one, and am always interested in adding more features/figuring out how to increase its efficiency.

 - Township: A game I made a long time ago using the NetBeans IDE, as opposed to my current IDE of Eclipse,
